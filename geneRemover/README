This is the source code for a C++ program designed to edit an inputted fasta file. 
The program takes an inputted string and copies the fasta file, omitting any entries that contain the regex inputted.
The input is expected to be inclosed in quotes and thefore the first and last remove characters are removed, i.e. input: "ERV", regex: ERV
